quiztastic
==========

Quiztastic is an angular module that lets you create a simple interactive quiz simply by using a single HTML5 "quiz" tag. It accepts a single parameter: a URL to a quiz specification in JSON.

It creates an interactive quiz that simply shows whether the person is correct or wrong.
CSS transforms are used and since this uses AngularJS you probably want a modern browser.
